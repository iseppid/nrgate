Our aim is to raise energy usage awareness using technology to visualize energy consumption. Instead of just hoping that individuals will reduce their energy usage because it is the right thing to do, we reimagined a product prototype that will be engaging, useful, and fun for all end users: NRGATE. \r\n\r\n![Poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptrollins/nrgate/master/nrgate%20poster.png)",
